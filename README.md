# Arduino Strobe Light Circuit and Diagram for Ultralight Aircraft

This repository contains a simple blueprint, including schematics, diagrams and code for the installation of LED strobe lights (winglets and tail) on ultralight aircraft or for general aviation aircraft classified as experimental.

Each lamp is made up of at least one series of 3 high power 3W LEDs powered directly at 12-14 Volts.

Prototype PCBs with aluminum base have been created for the lamps for better heat dissipation (thanks to JLCPCB).

The LEDs used are [HL-EF13W3NAMS (Ra2)](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Light-Emitting-Diodes-LED_HONGLITRONIC-Hongli-Zhihui-HONGLITRONIC-HL-EF13W3NAMS-Ra2_C784723.html) in which for each series of 3 a SMD type rectifier diode (SMC) code [S5G](https://lcsc.com/product-detail/Diodes-Fast-Recovery-Rectifiers_Shandong-Jingdao-Microelectronics-ES5GC_C128705.html) has been added to avoid polarity inversions.

Gerber files are available for download within the repository.
